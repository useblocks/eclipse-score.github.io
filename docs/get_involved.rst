How to get in contact with SCORE
--------------------------------

If you want to get into contact with SCORE, these are your primary entry points: 

:Project Mailing List: score-dev@eclipse.org

:Architectural Discussion: `#score-project-open-channel <https://sdvworkinggroup.slack.com/archives/C083Z4VL90B>`__

| **General Information / Alignment regarding SCORE as a basis for distributions & products:** 
| Contact one of the project leads of SCORE https://projects.eclipse.org/projects/automotive.score/who

The technical HOWTO regarding involvement into SCORE is described here: 
https://github.com/eclipse-score/score/blob/main/CONTRIBUTION.md

How to get involved into SCORE
------------------------------

The :underline:`only` way to influence SCORE is TO CONTRIBUTE. Everybody can contribute â€“ SCORE is open.

Active Contributions to the SCORE project are the basis for getting involved. The SCORE Project works according to 
the Eclipse Project Handbook and has named and elected project leads and committers (see https://projects.eclipse.org/projects/automotive.score/who). 
Direction of the SCORE project is discussed and decided in the project lead circle, technical direction is created and prediscussed in the tech 
lead circle. Meeting notes are transparent via the SCORE github organization. (see https://github.com/orgs/eclipse-score/discussions)

We aim to build a safety ready full stack architecture, where components fit to each other in 
automotive grade Software Quality and performance. To achieve this, we follow a strict feature roadmap and architecture
and a rigid software development process (publicly available in the SCORE Project Handbook starting end of 2024). 

Contributions to the SCORE project must therefore follow the technical direction of the project and the SCORE 
architecture. All work in SCORE will therefore follow a "Contribution Request" Process. Features on the roadmap of 
SCORE are defined, Contribution Requests create the basis for individual contributions from within the SCORE 
project and also from the outside.

You can make proposals for new features or architectural building blocks besides the active contribution requests. 
Those will not by default be part of the next release of SCORE, because the SCORE release roadmap will strictly 
comply with the contribution request structure. 
We plan to have the initial contribution request structure available in the SCORE GitHub until Q1 / 2025.

We plan to incorporate a staging area for such contributions, but
in the initial phase of the SCORE project (until end of 2025) the focus will be primarily on building a valid 1.0 
release. Feel free to reach out via the communication channels above.

If you think about your contribution to SCORE, the Contribution Request overview
is the best place to start (available on https://github.com/eclipse-score/score/issues starting Q1 / 2025)

Based on successful code contributions to the SCORE roadmap, further steps in involvement (like becoming a committer) 
will be handled according to the rules of the Eclipse Foundation Project Handbook. We value real code based 
collaboration and will judge new potential contributors and committers mainly on the validity of their work. Active 
and sustaining contributions are the basis for the ability to shape SCORE.

Making active code contributions via the contribution request process described in the Project Handbook. The 
project handbook will be available on the SCORE website until end of 2024.
